# Raspberry Pi Transmitter
Passionate pursuit (Olin College Fall 2017) independent project documentation.

# Summary
The purpose of this project was to explore embedded systems by making a radio transmitter that could control a remote-controlled car through a raspberry pi without any additional hardware. In the process, I also acquired a HAM radio license. 
The documentation, namely a poster, has been attached here.
